# Animation Rigging: Advanced Setups

A small collection of advanced samples for the Animation Rigging package. Each of the included scenes contains a character rigged with several constraints, demonstrating how they can all work together to drive interesting movements.

## Contents:

The project contains several examples, each one in its own scene:

**1 Layered Animation:** a scene with a character from the Tower Defence assets, rigged to allow independent activation of different animation features: IK on hands, multi-parent on the sword, while using head aiming to follow another character.

**2 Object Interaction:** the character has a character controller which allows for looking at interactable objects and, pressing spacebar, interacting with them. The use of IK allows the animation to work regardless of the angle that the character uses to approach the object.
